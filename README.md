# Iris Flower Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 This Python script implements a machine learning pipeline to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Using the Iris dataset (a standard dataset for ML), the script:  
 1. Loads the dataset and organizes it into a pandas DataFrame. 
 2. Splits the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split). 
 3. Trains an SVM model with a linear kernel to classify the iris species. 
 4. Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance on the test set using accuracy. 
 5. Visualizes the results with a confusion matrix heatmap, showing true vs. predicted values.
This project demonstrates the use of SVM for multi-class classification and visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
